Multiplayer Social Interference Heist Game

A third person heist game built in Unreal Engine 4 using primarily C++, where the players goal is to rob a bank, but players can use different abilities to interfere with their fellow thieves, which could result in them being caught, such as replacing a key weapon with a fake. This allows for players to achieve more money themselves, which can be used for further upgrades, cosmetic or otherwise.
